## 2. Vision Statement
Colorful match-3 puzzle game, with quick, 1v1, interactive matches in real time. Aimed to be very explosive and cheerful, in a cartoonish way. The campaign and multiplayer modes both reward the player with items and coins to buy them, in order to win more games and complete the item album. The game aims to convey a feeling of great accomplishment in completing sections of the campaign and pages of the album, awarding special prizes when the player can achieve these results.

### 2.1. Game Logline
“Embark on a journey to fight back the forces of evil, one puzzle at a time.”

### 2.2. Gameplay Synopsis

#### Uniqueness
The game is a match-3 that delivers a 1v1, competitive experience, both in PvP and in PvE. In addition to converting the classic match-3 gameplay experience into a multiplayer one, it features consumables the player can collect and use to win matches (or campaign levels), as bonuses for themselves or maluses for the enemy.

#### Functioning & Core Mechanics
Each player has a set number of moves:

* During the campaign, it depends on the level
* In PvP, 30 moves

Each move consists in swapping 2 faces or using a consumable item from the inventory.
Each player plays on a board of 6x7 tiles, all filled with faces to match.

The match has a set timer of 3 minutes, after which, if the match hasn't ended already, the player with the highest current score will result as winner.

Score is assigned according to the classic rules of match-3: each 3-or-more-object group the player manages to match disappears and awards points based on the size of the group, and, if "combos" are generated by this move, they will award bonus points based on the combo length. Combos are described in further detailed in the Gameplay section.

#### Setting
Ludenia was a peaceful kingdom, full of joy and inhabited by carefree, happy people. But that all changed, the day the Dreary Armada attacked. Battle rages on throughout the kingdom, and there's only one hero that can stop this catastrophe from destroying the happiness of the Ludenians and avoid the worst: the player. The kingdom of Ludenia is a fantasy, medieval kingdom, where the citizens have been morphed into sad statues.
The Dreary Armada is an army of people who just were to listen to a concert, performed by [Pun on some singer name + sadness], and armed up to deprive the whole world of the happiness they will never grasp again.

#### Look and feel

![Example of a normal match screen](pictures/Look-n-feel.png)

## 3. Audience, Platform, and Marketing

### 3.1. Target Audience
The game targets adults (35-50) living in urban areas of western europe, regardless of gender, with a casual mindset, with any schedule.

### 3.2. Platform
Mobile Android devices, as the market for this kind of games flourishes on mobile platforms. That is where the potential audience of the game would look for it. Match-3 gameplay is experienced at its best on a touch screen.

### 3.3. System requirements
Android 5.0+, as Android 5 constitutes 89% of the Android market right now.

### 3.4. Top performers
Candy Crush, Toon Blast, Matchington Mansion, Farm Heroes.

### 3.5. Feature comparison
Competitors do not feature PvP, while they usually include longer and more complex levels and puzzl-ish mechanics, and the slower pace that comes with them.

## 5. Gameplay

### 5.1. Overview
The game is about matching groups of 3 or more faces on a grid by swapping couples of them. Only adjacent faces can be swapped, vertically or horizontally. Furthermore, the game includes playable cards that can change the state of the game for the player or their opponent.

### 5.2. Gameplay description

##### Mechanics

###### Faces
The game is about making faces disappear ("freeing" them from the evil curse) by matching groups of them. The main part of the in-match GUI consists of a grid of 6x7 faces of random colours (6 columns x 7 rows), as is described in further detail in the Interfaces section. The player can swap couples of adjacent faces by "spending" a move - meaning their move count diminishes by one for each swap they perform. A swap is EFFECTIVE only if it actually "groups" 3 or more faces of the same colour, meaning if a swap doesn't cause any face to disappear, it is automatically reverted by the game. In this case, the move is not spent.

###### Moves
Every player starts the match with a set number of moves and cannot usually gain any (some cards cause exceptions to this rule). PvP matches grant 30 starting moves, campaign scenarios grant a different number of moves based on the single level.

###### Score
Each time faces disappear, they grant score based on the size of the group of faces matched. 3-faces matches grant 30 points, 4-faces grant 60, 5-faces grant 100, 7-faces grant 300

###### Score Threshold
Each level has a minimum score the player must reach in order to achieve victory. This number varies throughout the campaign, while in PvP matches it's a fixed 1200.

###### Cards
Cards are items the player can use at the expense of moves, with the cost depending on the single card. The player can unlock them by playing the campaign or by buying packs with coins they gain through PvP matches. Cards are either blue, if they provide a bonus or help for the player, or red, if they damage the opponent. Cards are played by tapping on them.

###### Coins
After every PvP match, the player will be granted coins: 15 if they win, 5 if they lose. Coins can be gained either this way or through spending real money. They can only be "lost" by buying packs. Cards can be either common or rare.
	Card example: Bomb

###### Packs
There are 2 card packs that can be bought in the Shop (see Interfaces for the Shop), one providing 1 card for 100 coins and one providing 3 cards for 250 coins. Cards are randomized based on their rarity: each card has 95% of being common and 5% of being rare.

### 5.3. Controls
The game is controlled through the phone's touch screen.

**Choosing the cards before a game:** tapping a card on the grid will move it into the "selected cards" area. Tapping on it in the selected cards area will move it back into the grid.

**Swapping:** swapping 2 faces is done by "dragging" one in a particular direction, either vertical or horizontal. The first point of pressure pinpoints the face to move, moving the finger towards another face selects it as the second one to swap.

**Using non-targeting cards:** a card can be used by double tapping on it. The first tap will highlight the card, while the second will "confirm" the selection and activate the effect. Tapping anywhere else after the first tap will cancel the card selection.

**Using targeting cards:** a card that needs to target a cell can be activated by tapping on it once. An arrow will appear from it towards the center of the board. The second tap, that is to be performed on a face, will activate the effects on the selected face. Tapping outside of the board will cancel the card selection.

#### 5.3.1. Interfaces
For all interfaces, the phone is considered to be in portrait mode, vertically held.

##### Main menu
The main screen features the necessary buttons, the details of which will be further described in the assets section, on a static background. The buttons are, as they appear from top to bottom:

* Campaign
* Duel
* Shop
* Settings

The main menu screen will also feature a red X button to quit the game on the top right side of the screen.

##### Shop screen
The shop will feature Robin on the bottom left of the screen, filling the whole bottom part with a conversazion balloon containing "Hey! Nothing better than some new gear to go into battle again!". Above him the screen will show 3 different kinds of card packs, with their pricing and the "BUY!" button.
When the player taps on a pack, a small balloon will appear from it. From top to bottom, the packs will be:

* Card Pack - 60 gold - Balloon: "Contains 3 new cards!"
* BIG Pack - 120 gold - Balloon: "Contains 7 new cards, convenient!"
* THE PACK-O - 300 gold - Balloon: "Contains 20 new cards! HUGE DEAL!"

The top left corner shows a little insertion with the player's money account, with a small "+" button on the side. Tapping on the money or the + will open the "buy coins with real money" pop-up. The exchange rate is €1 - 100 gold, with bigger bundles to be decided upon.

##### Card selection
The card selection pop-up appears before queuing for a game or going into a campaign level. It holds a square grid of all the cards the player owns on the top, the square's side being half of the screen's height, and a bottom section of 4 slots to see what cards have been chosen so far.

##### In-game UI
The in-game interface is as the look-and-feel section shows. In addition to those elements, the "ME" and "OPPO" sections feature a small bar on the bottom of their respective squares that empties to the left in 30 seconds, resetting everytime the assigned player makes a move. That bar is the inactivity bar, that makes the player lose the game if it empties completely. There is also a main time bar, showing how much time is left, below the 2 squares, just as broad as the 2 squares together.

##### Settings menu
The settings menu has the same look of the main menu. The background and X button stay the same, will the menu button change into:

* Music
* Sound effects
* Credits

Music and Sound effects button, if tapped, will grey out and turn music or sound effects off. If tapped on again, the effect will be reverted.
The Credits button, if tapped, will show our team's and respective names - yay!

##### Level selection
The campaign level selection screen features a "path" connecting the levels, which are represented with buttons with their numbers above them. The background shows the land of Ludenia.
All completed levels will appear as blue, smiling faces, the next level to complete will appear as a sad, red face. Unlocked levels will appear as sad, stone-grey faces.

#### 5.3.2. Rules
The number of possible moves is set for each game. Time is set only in multiplayer games.

It is not possible to swap 2 faces if this does not cause any match to happen. The swap will be reversed and the move will not be spent.

A PvP match can result in a player's victory or a draw. A draw happens if both players hit the same score or if no player can reach the score threshold.

The player has to make at least one move every 30 seconds. Otherwise, victory will be granted to the opponent due to inactivity. If this happens, it will not be possible for the inactive player to join a game for 3 minutes.

The card the player can use are to be selected through an ad-hoc screen before entering the game (or level). The same card cannot be used again without making 10  9 other moves first.

#### 5.3.3. Scoring/winning conditions
Campaign: the level is won if the player can achieve a level-depending score withing the given number of moves.

PvP: the player who, having reached the threshold, reaches the highest score, wins the game. Alternatively, if a player does not make a move for 30 seconds straight, their opponent wins the game.

### 5.4. Game modes and other features
**Campaign:** a series of levels to be played in a sequence. A level cannot be accessed if the previous one has not been defeated. The campaign is a single player mode of 30 different levels, with different mechanics emerging with higher levels. This mode awards coins and cards with the rules described above. In this mode, griefing cards (the ones that hinder the opponent's gameplay) are not usable.

**PvP:** the core of the game. This mode consists of 1v1 matches, not longer than 3 minutes. In this mode, all cards are allowed. This mode rewards coins as described above.

### 5.5. Levels
Levels are generated through an Random Content Generation algorithm, with due restrictions (for example on the number of face colours present in the level) based on their "position" in the campaign.

### 5.6. Flowchart

## 6. Game Characters

### 6.1. Characters design

##### Zeely
The player's guide is a trust-inspiring, colorful little parrot. It has a yellow body, red chest and light blue underwings and head, and green eyes. He is always cheerful and full of energy, never appearing without smiling eyes. The anatomy is a standard Forpus' parrot one.

##### Robin
The shop-keeper is a short boy, wearing robes a bit too big for him, but not so much to make him look goofy. He has short, brown hair, big blue eyes and a big pair of round glasses on them. His clothes are mostly Risultati immagini per blue color 2661F7 blue, with ocra yellow adornments on the edges. As an apprentice wizard, he also wears a big blue pointy hat of the same making, so big he has to keep a hand on it to prevent it from falling. Just like Zeely, he is always cheerful, presenting himself with an open smile every time he appears.

All the characters described above are NPC. They only appear to tell the player something, or to adobe the shop's screen. They have hence no A.I.
