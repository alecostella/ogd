NOTA BENE: this outline is a list of suggested topics. Please exclude from your document the items that do not apply to your game (e.g.: the does not have a story with subplots, etc.)!

NOTA BENE 2: the final version of the GDD should be complete (i.e. it describes the whole game) and it must include a section that summarizes which are the parts of the game that have been included in the prototype. Otherwise, we will expect that everything described in the GDD have been developed...

Add a cover page including at least:
