# Technical Design Document

NOTA BENE: this outline is merely a list of suggested topics. Please include in your document only the items that apply
to your game!
KEEP IN MIND: you are planning an open beta / greenlight project, not the full product

##	1. Project Goal
Describe here what you want to provide to your customers/players from a technology standpoint.
E.g., 7/24 game availability for mobile platforms running Symbian 1.0 and connecting via intra-satellite photonic link
for a gesture-based MUD

##	2. Innovation
Required innovation to current technology (if any)


##	3. Provided Services (besides the game)
E.g., Customer support, forum, grocery delivery, car washing, paycheck advance …


##	4. Client Side

	###	4.1	Hardware requirements
	It is fine to make references to the GDD

	###	4.2	Software requirements
	It is fine to make references to the GDD

##	5. Workload estimation
Target workload for your infrastructure in term of total users, peak users, and resources dedicated to each user.
Starting from an initial system capacity and extend later is fine but then you must provide an extension plan.
MOTIVATE THIS referencing the GDD

##	6. Frontend

	###	6.1	Platforms
	Motivate your selection

	###	6.2	Hardware
	Not just “what” but also “how many”

	###	6.3	Software

	###	6.4	Scalability and Extensibility
	How are you planning to quickly extend you infrastructure when and if needed

##	7.	Backend
Remember to put databases here!

###	7.1	Platforms
Motivate your selection

###	7.2 Hardware
Not just “what” but also “how many”

###	7.3	Software

###	7.4	Workload capacity
Give some rationale why this infrastructure should stand the intended workload


##	8.	Development

###	8.1	Platforms

###	8.2	Hardware
Not just “what” but also “how many”

###	8.3	Software
Not just “what” but also “how many”

###	8.4	Major Software Development Tasks
We need a list here

###	8.5	Development Gantt
Yes, this is MANDATORY!

##	9.	External Services
Whatever service you will buy/rent from third parties
If you opt in for cloud, this is NOT the right place, put it in § 6 or § 7

##	10.	Communication	

###	10.1	Global Infrastructure Outline
How servers are connected (hint: use a picture)
What is installed on each server

###	10.2	Network Requirements
Bandwidth, latency, type of connection, QoS in general
Inside and outside your infrastructure

###	10.3	Network Hardware
Not just “what” but also “how many” … if any


##	11.	Delivery

###	11.1	Estimated Delivery Time
To be compliant with your GANTT

###	11.2	Delivery Platform
This is about the channels you are going to use to deliver the game to your players

###	11.3	Delivery Methodology
This is about how you are going to use your distribution channel

##	12.	Staff

###	12.1	For Infrastructure Setup

###	12.2	For Infrastructure Management

###	12.3	In Game

###	12.4	Other

##	13.	Potential Security Issues

Not mandatory, but companies like it A LOT

##	14.	Other	
Whatever pops up in your mind and is interesting / cost money
